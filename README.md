Contains:

``mycelium_3D_reconstruction.m`` for reproducing the results in Figure 7. 

``overlap_detection_in_2D.m`` for reproducing the results in Table 3.

``printed_filament_3D_reconstruction.m`` and ``printed_filaments_3D_reconstruction_more_complex.m`` for reproducing the results in Figure 6 and Table 2. The first script is for Prototypes #1-2, and the second for Prototypes #3-5. The distinction is due to differences in image aquisition setup.

``qualitative_results.m`` for reproducing the results in Figures 8 and 9.

``time_lapse_plotting.m`` for reproducing the results in Figure 10

``fcn/`` contains all necessary functions.

``fcn/external/`` functions originally authored by external authors (see each specific function).

 

### Result_tables:
The excel spreadsheet contains the data and computations in Table 3.


### Data:
Contains all data including images and annotations.

### GT_overlap_tests
Contains the annotation files for reproducing the results in Table 3.

### Remarks

The branch/crossing detection and branch/crossing matching tests are not fully automated, since a couple of cases were too complex to annotate. In these cases the person performing the test must determine visually if the algorithm's assessment is correct or not.

In image "o.jpg", a filament in the top right corner traverses multiple structures and must be assessed maunally.  Running overlap_detection_in_2D.m. with the parameters reported in the manuscript makes this crossing not detected, so one
 "false negative" must be added.


The reader who is currious about the functionaliy of the graph merging algorithm many run the function mergeGraphs.m in debug mode. Just open the function and set debug_mode = 1 instead of debug_mode = 0.
